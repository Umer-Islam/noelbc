//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let moviesList = ['robot','aliens','good bad and ugly']
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let firstMovie = moviesList[0]
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let lengthMoviesList = moviesList.length
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let moviesListLast = moviesList[lengthMoviesList.length-1]
